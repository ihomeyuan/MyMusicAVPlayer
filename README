Modified from Apple's Sample Code StitchedStreamPlayer, and fix some bugs of it.
    In Apple's Code when you change it to play more then one AVPlayerItem it will crash.
    The Origin code of Apple's sample first addObservers and then make replaceCurrentItemWithPlayerItem, 
this resulting a crash when a notification for the previous item calls after that item is released. 
I changed the order to first make replaceCurrentItemWithPlayerItem and then addObservers and fix the crash bug.
    And I turned this sample code into a pure music player, which can do play, pause, next and previous audio work, together with background audio playing with remote controlling as well!
    Fix some memory bugs of StitchedStreamPlayer when receiving level 2 memory warning.
